## üéì Approach Explanation (300-500 words)

Our persona-driven document intelligence solution addresses the core challenge of extracting contextually relevant information from multi-document collections through a sophisticated three-stage pipeline.

**Stage 1: Intelligent Document Segmentation**  
We begin by extracting and segmenting documents using an enhanced version of our Challenge 1A text extraction pipeline. Each PDF is analyzed to identify natural section boundaries using heading patterns, font analysis, and content structure. This creates semantically coherent sections rather than arbitrary text chunks, preserving context and improving relevance scoring accuracy.

**Stage 2: Semantic Query Construction**  
The persona role and job-to-be-done are transformed into a comprehensive search query through intelligent term extraction and context weighting. We identify domain-specific keywords from the persona (e.g., "Travel Planner" ‚Üí travel, itinerary, accommodation) and task-specific requirements from the job description (e.g., "4-day trip" ‚Üí duration, group activities). This creates a multi-faceted query that captures both the user's expertise domain and specific information needs.

**Stage 3: Relevance-Based Content Extraction**  
Using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer model, we encode both the constructed query and all document sections into high-dimensional semantic vectors. Cosine similarity scoring identifies the most relevant sections, which are then ranked by importance. For each top section, we perform granular subsection analysis, extracting the most pertinent paragraphs or sentences that directly address the persona's needs.

**Technical Innovation**  
Our approach innovates through context-preserving segmentation, persona-aware query enhancement, and hierarchical relevance analysis. Unlike simple keyword matching, our semantic embeddings understand conceptual relationships and domain expertise levels. The TF-IDF fallback ensures robustness when computational resources are constrained.

**Performance & Scalability**  
The solution is optimized for the 60-second constraint through efficient model selection (MiniLM vs. larger alternatives), parallel document processing, and intelligent content chunking. The Docker container pre-caches the transformer model, eliminating runtime download overhead and ensuring consistent offline performance.

This comprehensive approach delivers precise, persona-relevant content extraction that scales effectively across diverse document collections and user scenarios.
